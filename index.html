            <h2>Hello world, it's me!</h2>
            <p>As a lifelong musician and problem solver, I am constantly trying to work on and apply new knowledge to better myself as a worker, artist, musician, teammate, friend and human being. 
            Having played every role in a music group and held most roles in restaurants, I have great respect and patience for those around me.     
            Much like managing my diabetes; my role as a software developer requires recognizing all the components working, or not, in an environment to identitify and maintain exceptionalism in its many facets.
            I chose software development because I believe it's a cumlimination of every soft skill and creative outlet I've developed since I began my first job throwing newspapers when I was 9 years old. </p>
